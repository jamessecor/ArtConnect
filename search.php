			<h1>Search Page</h1>
			<p>
			The search page shows all search options available to a user. This page is a combination of the search functions found on individual ArtConnect pages.
			Users can search within their messages and threads, and can also search through all threads in ArtConnect. 
			In addition, users can search for images that other users have uploaded. Searches are performed within a certain, user-defined scope. 
			If no options are selected, the entirety of ArtConnect is searched. The following list shows ways users can search.
